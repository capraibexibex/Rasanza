# Gate Timing System

## Overview

This Arduino sketch is designed for a gate timing system, utilizing various sensors and modules to detect and record the timing of objects passing through a gate. Key components include LoRa communication, an OLED display, GPS, an SD card for data logging, and an AHTX0 sensor for temperature and humidity readings.

## Features

- **LoRa Communication:** Enables wireless data transmission between gates.
- **OLED Display:** Shows system status, sensor readings, and messages.
- **GPS Module:** Provides location data for the system.
- **SD Card Logging:** Records timing, temperature, humidity, and other relevant data.
- **Voltage Detection:** Monitors voltage levels to detect object passage at the gate.

## Hardware Setup

- Adafruit SH1107 OLED display
- Adafruit AHTX0 sensor for temperature and humidity
- GPS module compatible with Adafruit_GPS library
- LoRa module using RH_RF95 driver
- SD card module for data logging

## Software Dependencies

- Adafruit_GFX and Adafruit_SH110X libraries for the OLED display
- Adafruit_AHTX0 library for the temperature and humidity sensor
- SPI and SD libraries for SD card functionality
- RH_RF95 library for LoRa communication
- Adafruit_GPS library for GPS functionality

## Configuration

Ensure all hardware components are correctly wired to the Arduino, and corresponding libraries are installed. Modify the pin configurations in the code to match your setup.

## Usage

Upload the sketch to your Arduino device after setting up the hardware. Monitor the serial output and OLED display for system status and sensor readings.

## Customization

You can customize the code to suit your specific requirements, such as adjusting the LoRa frequency, changing the OLED display messages, or modifying the data logging format.
